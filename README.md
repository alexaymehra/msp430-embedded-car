## Overview
The **MSP430 Embedded Car** is a class project that uses the MSP430FR2355 microcontroller and other peripherals to enable remote-controlled movements and functions, as well as autonomous black-line detection and following. This project demonstrates how embedded C programming can be used to control a physical system.

## Features
* Sensor calibration for accurate line-detection values
* Real‑time, interrupt‑driven sensor readings (ADC / timers / ports)
* Line detection and line‑following logic based on IR detector inputs
* Motor and wheel control abstractions for driving / steering
* Modular code organization (sensors, wheels, initialization, communication, etc.) for easy customization
* Optional IoT / Wi‑Fi / communication module support (depending on hardware)
* Minimal dependencies — designed for bare‑metal microcontroller development

## Hardware
* MSP430FR2355 microcontroller
* LCD display board
* FET board
* Motors
* IR emitter and detector board
* ESP32 IOT module
