## Overview
This project uses the MSP430FR2355 microcontroller and other peripherals such as a FET board, motors, an LCD Dispaly, IR emitters, an IR detector, an ESP32, and a DAC board to allow the car to execute remote-controlled movements and autonomously detect and follow a black line (e.g. black tape).

## Features
* Line detection and line‑following logic based on analog/digital sensor inputs
* Sensor calibration routines for improved detection accuracy
* Real‑time, interrupt‑driven sensor reading (ADC / timers / ports)
* Motor and wheel control abstractions for driving / steering
* Modular code organization (sensors, wheels, initialization, communication, etc.) for easy customization
* Optional IoT / Wi‑Fi / communication module support (depending on hardware)
* Minimal dependencies — designed for bare‑metal microcontroller development
